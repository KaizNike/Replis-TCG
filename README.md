# Replis TCG - Godot 4.4.1.stable
Animal befriending to defend you in a wild world, made with help of Microsoft Copilot.

I'm too lazy to code and had a big trip so I'm using Copilot.

## Goals:
- A test of wits, stamina and speed, throw down your animal friends and use your ally abilities to knock other opponents out. The better tuned the deck one player has, the more opportunities for your cards to trip em up. For example let's say you're playing against a discovery deck thats tuned to get an overwhelming presence on the board. All Aoes have the chance to do friendly fire or draw aggro to other players, so thats out. Another option is to set up your dualities so you make it to hard for that player to throw any more cards down. "Dualities" being a system where cards may have 1-5 different natures that stack to make it a puzzle how to remove them from the field without pissing them off. 
- The Art: Cards are currently set to be 140x190 to match with the template given. 
- Plays Like: BS with too many new rules
- Story: You pick a starting animal to follow and play solo with event (standard playing) cards, the goal is after a number of matches to build up a team, spare natures, abilities, and choose a human ally.
